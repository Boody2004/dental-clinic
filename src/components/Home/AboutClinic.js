              Safeguarding patients privacy and confidentiality in todayâ€™s
              health care environment is increasingly challenging. Advanced
              technology, new demands in health care, and development, make it
              more and more difficult to do so.

              care providers and it is our duty to protect the well being of
              those who are entrusted to our care.
